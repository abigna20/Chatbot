# Chatbot

This is a voice-based chatbot, which can reply to your texts through voice. The perk being the chatbot is based on a character called Sae'yang from Heitian by Musuli. You don't have to necessarily know the character to enjoy the chatbot, he's sarcastic and doesn't really care for much. 

You can download the sae_chatbot.py file and run it with the command python sae_chatbot.py 

Hope you enjoy!

Project details: 
 - Sae_chatbot.py uses pyttsx3 library and nltk library to create a chatbot that has pre-defined response to users questions via voice. The pre-defined responses are based on nltk library while the voice enabling is based on the pyttsx3 library.
 - It also uses tkinter for the user interface.
